# CP20 TASK 8A — RESEARCH PROMPT

## Critical-Site Density Pressure

Date: 2026-08-26
Status: `[COMPUTATIONAL PHASE DONE — THEOREM PHASE OPEN]`

---

## 0. What is already done

The first computational phase has been carried out. **Do not redo it;
verify it and build the theorem on it.** Results and code:
`10-task8a/HESAP_SONUCLARI.md`, `01_basinc_yuzeyi.py`,
`02_cp19t4_koprusu.py`.

Established numerically:

- the three-variable surface reduces analytically to one variable;
- the two critical-site types are **strongly asymmetric**;
- `rho_min(kappa)` was computed;
- the surface interpolates between Task 7 (`rho=0`) and CP19 T4
  (`rho=optimal`) to within 0.1%;
- CP19 T5's explicit survivor fails the density requirement by three
  orders of magnitude.

## 1. Setting (unchanged from Task 6/7)

`alpha = log_2 3`, `F_k = floor(alpha k)`, `g_k = F_{k+1}-F_k in {1,2}`,
`s_k = F_k - sum_{i<k} a_i`. Hypotheses (H1) `s_k = kappa log_2 k + O(1)`,
(H2) `kappa > 1`.

Task 7 assumed additionally `a_k != g_k` for every `k`. **Task 8A drops
that assumption.**

Define the critical indicator `c_k = 1{a_k = g_k}` and split by type:

```
rho_1 = density of { k : g_k = 1 and a_k = 1 }      (rho_1 <= 2-alpha)
rho_2 = density of { k : g_k = 2 and a_k = 2 }      (rho_2 <= alpha-1)
```

## 2. The surface

With Lagrange multipliers `lambda` (total defect) and `mu_1, mu_2`
(critical counts, **free sign** — the constraint is equality, not
inequality):

```
H(lambda,mu_1,mu_2) = (2-alpha) log_2( 2^{mu_1} + A(lambda) )
                    + (alpha-1) log_2( 2^{mu_2} + B(lambda) )
                    - mu_1 rho_1 - mu_2 rho_2

A(lambda) = sum_{a>=2} e^{lambda(1-a)}
B(lambda) = sum_{a>=1, a!=2} e^{lambda(2-a)}
```

Solving `dH/dmu_i = 0` in closed form gives

```
2^{mu_1} = rho_1 A/(2-alpha-rho_1),    2^{mu_2} = rho_2 B/(alpha-1-rho_2)
```

and the surface collapses to

```
h(rho_1,rho_2) = inf_{lambda>0} [ (2-alpha-rho_1) log_2 A(lambda)
                                + (alpha-1-rho_2) log_2 B(lambda) ]
                 + E_1 + E_2

E_1 = (2-alpha)log_2(2-alpha) - (2-alpha-rho_1)log_2(2-alpha-rho_1) - rho_1 log_2 rho_1
E_2 = (alpha-1)log_2(alpha-1) - (alpha-1-rho_2)log_2(alpha-1-rho_2) - rho_2 log_2 rho_2
```

`E_1,E_2` are the selection entropy of *which* sites are critical;
critical sites are frozen (one symbol), the rest sit under pressure.

## 3. Target theorem

Combine with the frozen Task 6 lower bound
`liminf log_2 p_a(r)/r >= alpha/kappa`:

```
alpha/kappa  <=  h(rho_1,rho_2)
```

**Required statement:**

> If a positive ordinary odd-only Syracuse orbit satisfies (H1),(H2),
> then its critical-site densities must satisfy
> `h(rho_1,rho_2) >= alpha/kappa`. In particular the total critical
> density is at least `rho_min(kappa)`, with
> `rho_min(kappa) = 0` for `kappa >= alpha/h(0,0) = 2.7840109...`
> and `rho_min(1.06) ≈ 0.351`.

## 4. Mandatory tasks

1. **Derive the closed form for `mu_i` independently.** Verify the sign
   convention: the equality constraint requires free `mu`; an inequality
   constraint (`<= rho`) would force `mu <= 0` and give a different
   surface. State which one the Chernoff step actually licenses.
2. **Justify the Parikh step in the presence of critical sites.**
   Task 7 relied on Sturmian balance (two Parikh values differing by 1).
   Check whether the `rho_1`/`rho_2` split preserves this, since the
   critical positions are themselves selected relative to `g`.
3. **Prove or refute the asymmetry structurally.** The computation shows
   `rho_1` is the cheaper escape direction. Give the reason in the
   generating function, not only numerically.
4. **Explain the gap to CP19 T4.** `max h = 1.503981` versus
   `h(alpha) = 1.505644`. The conjecture is that the difference is
   exactly the entropy cost of the Sturmian phase constraint, which
   CP19 T4 does not impose. Prove this or find the real cause.
   If proved, Task 8A **strictly strengthens** CP19 T4 on this class.
5. **Rigorous certificate.** Reproduce `h(0,0)`, `max h` and at least
   three points of `rho_min(kappa)` in rational/interval arithmetic.
   No decimal may carry a proof-critical sign decision (CP17 standard).
6. **Counterexample discipline.** Test against: `rho_1 = 2-alpha`
   (all `g=1` sites critical); `rho_2 = alpha-1`; the degenerate corner
   `rho_1+rho_2 -> 1` (surface must give `h -> 0`); `kappa <= 1`;
   eventually periodic words.
7. **Literature.** Compare against the July 2026 preprint *"Entropy
   barriers for bounded-amplitude Collatz cycles"*, which reportedly
   uses mechanical/Sturmian factor languages, repeated-factor
   divisibility, entropy and Perron–Frobenius certificates in one
   pipeline. Its theorem targets bounded-amplitude **cycles**; ours
   targets critical-log **orbit realization**. Establish precisely
   whether the pressure surfaces coincide.

## 5. Verdict format

One of: `[PROVED]`, `[PROVED WITH WORDING REPAIR]`, `[FIXABLE GAP]`,
`[MAJOR GAP]`, `[FALSE — COUNTEREXAMPLE]`.

Separately state: the exact `rho_min(kappa)` curve; whether CP19 T5's
survivor is excluded; whether Task 8A subsumes CP19 T4; whether the
result can be frozen.

Do not state that Collatz is solved.

## 6. Downstream (Task 8B, do not start yet)

If Task 8A proves, the frontier becomes: *a survivor at `kappa ≈ 1.06`
must be critical at ~35% of its sites, concentrated on `g=1` positions.*
Task 8B asks whether a single positive ordinary integer can sustain that
density forever — using the Sinai/Kontorovich structure theorem
(arithmetic progressions realizing prescribed valuation prefixes) and
ordinary-state arithmetic.
